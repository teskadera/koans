  # QUESTION: Which has precedence: The constant in the lexical scope,
  # or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?
  # Lexical scope. Another oddity. This one took a bit to understand, with help
  # from these two links:
  # https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.ruby/t5rtDNol3P8
  # http://stackoverflow.com/q/5464811/
  # The scoping here is within the MyAnimals class, where LEGS is 2, which
  # takes precedence over the LEGS value in Animals.

  # QUESTION: Now which has precedence: The constant in the lexical
  # scope, or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?  Why is it
  # different than the previous answer?
  # See answer above, to start. This class is defined as related-to-MyAnimals
  # but is not within the scope of the class definition of MyAnimals; it exists
  # in the namespace of, but not as a child class of MyAnimals.
